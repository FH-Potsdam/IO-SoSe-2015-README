##Abstract:  

A layout for what shoulde be an a repo  
This is an example on how to write markdown and what should be in a readme/repo for getting a good grade in the seminar [Input Output (Eingabe Ausgabe) Fundamentals of process-oriented design.](https://interface.fh-potsdam.de/eingabe-ausgabe/) @FH-Potsdam. You can write things in __bold__ and _italic_. You can add links like seen before. You will have to write your documentation in english. To add an paragraph just add two whitespaces like so -->  
I suggest you use the [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/) with the [Markdown Preview package](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-preview) installed. To learn more about markdown go to [remarq.io "five minutes to markdown mastery"](http://www.remarq.io/articles/five-minutes-to-markdown-mastery/), [daringfireball.net "markdown"](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) or [markdowntutorial.com](http://markdowntutorial.com/).


![You can add images](images/canvas.png)

##Prerequisite  

>something that is required in advance; "Latin was a prerequisite for admission"  
> - Terminology

This is the part where you explain what is needed beforehand to run your project. You can add unordered list with hypens `-` or asteriks `*`.  

- Something in a list unordered
- Something else  
* something with an asteriks  


##Dependencies  

In the dependencies section you can tell the reader what your project relies on. e.g if you are using Python you could write which modules. Or on the Raspberry Pi it would be the packages. Below you see an ordered list.  

1. Ordered list  
2. more things  

##Installation  

Here you tell what should be done to install your project. You could tell him to clone it with git and run some install script or just provide all the code to install all packages on a Raspberry Pi. This should be done in a code block if it is code. You can write code inline by enclosing it in ticks \` ` like this` or you can use 4 whitespaces like in the example below.  

    git clone 



##Usage  

Do that thing and that

    code with four spaces

##Something else  

Paragraphs can be created by adding two whitespaces.  

Images are added like this  

    ![]()
